                    The Japanese are neglecting the opportunity to synthesize a new
                    corporate culture based on a fusion of the best aspects of both
                    national cultures.

                There's also a usage &quot;neglect to X&quot; (eg &quot;John neglected to mention to
                Mary that he hated her.&quot;) which might or might not fit into this
                roleset, depending on your viewpoint.  It doesn't occur in the corpus,
                though, so the point is somewhat moot.
