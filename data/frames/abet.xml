                    [Eight admissions representatives at two of Wilfred's former
                    Massachusetts schools]-1 previously pleaded guilty to charges of
                    *trace*-1 aiding, abetting and counseling students to submit false
                    financial-aid applications.

                <note>
                    The action (submitting applications) is really connected with the PAS
                    of 'counsel' more than aid or abet.
