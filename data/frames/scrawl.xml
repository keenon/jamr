                    Somebody had scrawled American Express, Piazza di Spagna?, across the
                    envelope, and now Theresa had it, all as easily as if she had been
                    the President of the Republic or the Pope.

                    The ledger was full of most precise information: date of laying,
                    length of incubation period, number of chick reaching the first week,
                    second week, fifth week, weight of hen, size of rooster's wattles and
                    so on, all scrawled out in a hand that looked more Chinese than
                    English, the most jagged and sprawling Alex had ever seen.
