                Note:
                In most cases Treebank suggests an S-BAR as the object of &quot;say&quot;; PReditor
                selects the S inside the S-BAR as the Arg1.  I feel it really should be the
                S-BAR, because of the cases like &quot;John said THAT he loved Mary&quot; where
                the S-BAR is selected as Arg1, but in actual usage the complementizer
                is usually dropped.  But since it would slow down throughput
                *enormously* to retag all of these cases, we'll accept what PReditor
                selects in both cases (with and without complementizer).
