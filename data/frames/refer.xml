                    Two former ministers were so heavily implicated in the Koskotas
                    affair that [PASOK members of Parliament]-1 voted [*-1] to refer them
                    to the special court.

                The 'cite' sense of refer (I refer to the Oxford English dictionary
                for questions of word sense) fits under the first roleset, since it
                implicitly takes the arg2 &quot;as an authority&quot;.
