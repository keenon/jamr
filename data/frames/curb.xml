            Frames file for 'curb' based on sentences in financial subcorpus.
            No verbnet entry.  Comparison with 'reduce', but not really.  I'd
            rather have 'limit', but that hasn't been framed either.

                    [The CFTC]-1 plans *trace*-1 to curb dual trading on commodities
                    markets, in which traders buy and sell both for their own account
                    and for clients.

                I don't really expect the higher-numbered args to appear, but they're
                there for reference.  Neither do I expect the sense of &quot;please curb
                your dog&quot;.
