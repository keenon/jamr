                    Certainly [conservative environmentalists]-1 can defend their limited
                    government position by [*-1] differentiating between Old
                    Environmentalism and New Environmentalism (``Journalists and
                    Others for Saving the Planet,'' by David Brooks, editorial page,
                    Oct. 5).

                    Producers-2 also are trying [*-2] to differentiate by concentrating
                    on higher-profit output, such as coated and electrogalvanized
                    products, which remain beyond the reach of minimills.
