README for $JAVANLP_HOME/more/lib

This directory is intended to contain only *current and necessary*
.jar files used with JavaNLP.  Each jar file in lib should be without
its version number but include a corresponding source .zip/.jar file
with a full version number in the libsrc folder.  For example, if
there is a file  lib/ra.jar there should be a corresponding and
up-to-date libsrc/ra-0.1.8-src.zip.

Outdated or redundant .jar files should NOT be kept here, but should
be stored instead in /u/nlp/java/liball.  That directory should also
include copies of the current .jar files in this directory, but with
version numbers in the name.  Example: colt1.0.3.jar.

If you're adding a new .jar to the repository, please:
 - add the jar itself (without version number)
 - add its source zip (with version number)
 - if the .jar file has other libraries embedded which overlap with
   other javanlp libraries, please remove that
 - update the Eclipse .classpath file to include the jar and a path
   to its source, AND
 - also update this file with information about the jar.

Any .jar files which appear in this directory should be listed in
this file, with the following information:

ORIGINAL JAR NAME: original name of the .jar file when downloaded
VERSION: version number
RELEASE DATE: when the library was originally released.
SOURCE AVAILABLE: yes or no, if it is available it should be checked in
to the repository under libsrc
DESCRIPTION: a short description of the library's function and purpose.
URL: where to check for library information, documentation, and updates.
USED BY: what JavaNLP packages use this library.
LAST UPDATE: when we last updated our copy from the source.

colt.jar

ORIGINAL JAR NAME: colt.jar

VERSION: 1.2.0

RELEASE DATE: 2002/11/22

SOURCE AVAILABLE: libsrc/colt-1.2.0-src.zip

DESCRIPTION: "Open Source Libraries for High Performance Scientific and
Technical Computing in Java."

URL: http://acs.lbl.gov/~hoschek/colt/

USED BY:
used extensively in edu.stanford.nlp.linalg, edu.stanford.nlp.cluster,
edu.stanford.nlp.parser, several other places
The only place that this is still used in core is in
SentenceProbabilityParser, so it'd be a good candidate to move to more.

html-parser.jar

ORIGINAL JAR NAME: html-parser.jar

VERSION: 1.1.1

RELEASE DATE: 2005/07/08

SOURCE AVAILABLE: yes (at present the src in libsrc is slightly newer than
our installed version (1.2 versus 1.1.1) since as of 20071031, I can't find
src for 1.1.1 - Anna)

DESCRIPTION:
"This is a JavaCC grammar for parsing HTML documents. It does not enforce
the DTD, but instead builds a simple parse tree which can be used to
validate, reformat, display, analyze, or edit the HTML document. The goal
was to produce a parse tree which threw away very little information
contained in the source file, so that by dumping the parse tree, an almost
identical copy of the input document would result. The only source
information discarded by the parser is whitespace inside of tags (i.e., the
spaces or newlines between the attributes of a tag.) It is not confused by
things that look like tags inside of quoted strings."

DESCRIPTION: "JGraphT is a free Java class library that provides
mathematical graph-theory objects and algorithms. JGraphT supports a
rich gallery of graphs and is designed to be powerful, extensible, and
easy to use."

NOTE: The .jar file had a classpath which assumed jgraph.jar was in a
subdirectory, with the path lib/jgraph.jar.  This is not how we
organized our directory structure.  The easiest fix was to change the
manifest file in jgrapht.jar to point to the correct path (eg the
current directory).  It might even make sense to get rid of that
classpath... when are we really going to want that there?

DESCRIPTION: "JWNL is a Java API for accessing the WordNet relational

jwnlx.jar

ORIGINAL JAR NAME: jwnlx.jar

VERSION: 1.4

RELEASE DATE: 2008-01-22
MODIFIED VERSION, CREATION DATE: 2008-05-10

SOURCE AVAILABLE: yes

DESCRIPTION: "JWNL is a Java API for accessing the WordNet relational
dictionary. WordNet is widely used for developing NLP applications,
and a Java API such as JWNL will allow developers to more easily use
Java for building NLP applications."

URL: http://sourceforge.net/projects/jwordnet

This is a modified version of JWNL.  This corrects issues the following issues:

- Modified FileManagerImpl constructor() to search for sense index
  files correctly (previous version prefixed sense files with '\',
  resulting in a Windows filepath).
- Modified PointerTarget's getPointers() routine, to perform a null
  check on the value of getType() when iterating through types.  This
  is likely due to JWNL not being aware of the WN edge type, or a
  mistake in the file (this is a concession to get stuff working).
